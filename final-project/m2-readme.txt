As best we can tell, the columns of "release_group_alias.csv" in Musicbrainz are mislabeled. The given column names are "id, name, parent, ..." but sample rows look like "1, 138133, Earth Crossing,". There is no release_group column and thus apparently no way to connect this to the release_group data set. We think that what it calls "name" is actually the release_group IDs, and what it calls "parent" are actually the alias names. We are working under this assumption.
Two files for each diagram. The pdfs are in the repo as requested, as well as a png image that is easier to look at.
